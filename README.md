# Cyclistic bike-share Analysis (Using R and Tableau)
## Project Objective 
The Cyclistic team would like to understand more about their 2 different members, customers and subscribers and what the key differences between them are.

## Dataset was too large so it was split into 4 essential files

<a href="https://github.com/AlexdeLange1/Cyclistic-Analysis/blob/main/Top_10_Stations.csv">Top 10 stations</a> :
<a href="https://github.com/AlexdeLange1/Cyclistic-Analysis/blob/main/Rides_by_month.csv">Rides by month</a> :
<a href="https://github.com/AlexdeLange1/Cyclistic-Analysis/blob/main/Rides_by_day.csv">Rides by day</a> :
<a href="https://github.com/AlexdeLange1/Cyclistic-Analysis/blob/main/Rides_by_day.csv">Rides by hour</a>

## Questions (KPI's)

- What are the top 5 most popular starting stations
- Which days have the most bike rides
- How many customer rides are there each month
- How many susbcriber rides are there each month
- What are the busiest hours of the day

##Project insights
- Tourist attractions are the least popular stations as most of the Cyclistic bike users use the bikes for transport to work and back (more than 95%)
- The top 3 stations are: 1. Clinton St & Washington Blvd with 7563 rides. 2. Clinton St & Madison St with 6280 rides. 3. Canal St & Adams St with 6208 rides
- The most popular days are Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. All weekdays!
- The times with the most rides during the week are: 8am, 4pm and 5pm

## Final conclusions

Majority of the Cyclistic users are subscribers who need to use these bikes from transport to work and back. Customers, on the other hand, display the exact opposite trend. They use Cyclistics bikes for leisurely purposes and ride the most on weekends and visit tourist destinations the most. I recommned Cyclistic target these popular tourist areas where their customers go and do more promotion and marketing in those areas so that they can convert their customers into yearly subsribers. With a focus on the convenience it will provide, as well as the cost efficiency.
