# Cyclistic bike-share Analysis (Using R and Tableau)
## Project Objective 
The Cyclistic team would like to understand more about their 2 different members, customers and subscribers and what the key differences between them are.

## Dataset was too large so it was split into 4 essential files

<a href="https://github.com/AlexdeLange1/Cyclistic-Analysis/blob/main/Rides_by_month.csv">Rides by month</a> :
<a href="https://github.com/AlexdeLange1/Cyclistic-Analysis/blob/main/Rides_by_day.csv">Rides by day</a> :
<a href="https://github.com/AlexdeLange1/Cyclistic-Analysis/blob/main/Rides_by_day.csv">Rides by hour</a>
