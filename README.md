# Cyclistic bike-share Analysis (Using R and Tableau)
## Project Objective 
The Cyclistic team would like to understand more about their 2 different members, customers and subscribers and what the key differences between them are.

## Dataset was too large so it was split into 4 essential files

<a href="https://github.com/AlexdeLange1/Cyclistic-Analysis/blob/main/Top_10_Stations.csv">Top 10 stations</a> :
<a href="https://github.com/AlexdeLange1/Cyclistic-Analysis/blob/main/Rides_by_month.csv">Rides by month</a> :
<a href="https://github.com/AlexdeLange1/Cyclistic-Analysis/blob/main/Rides_by_day.csv">Rides by day</a> :
<a href="https://github.com/AlexdeLange1/Cyclistic-Analysis/blob/main/Rides_by_day.csv">Rides by hour</a>

## Questions (KPI's)

- What are the top 5 most popular starting stations
- Which days have the most bike rides
- How many customer rides are there each month
- How many susbcriber rides are there each month
- What are the busiest hours of the day
